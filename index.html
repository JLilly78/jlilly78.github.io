                I hope this isn't too distracting i really thought it would be fun to put up a ticker tape you know it just seems like a fun idea. I know it might be bad web design but you know what i just wanted to make something cool and quick but you know how it is. anyway im still trying to figure out what the heck i'm going to put on this website, like right now i just have a crappy c++ music player that doesn't fully work. I hope you like it anyway, i'm going to make it look nicer and work with all types of wav files but for now it only plays some, also the mp3 side of it isn't doing so well, sorry about that. I wish i was better at this, at least im happy with this website so far. I really DON'T LIKE wordpress and squarespace im really kind of antagonistic towards them you know gotta just make the website yourself besides wordpress is so hard to navigate whoever made the menus for wordpress is evil and should consider getting a life, don't you think?
