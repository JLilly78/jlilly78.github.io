                I hope this isn't too distracting i really thought it would be fun to put up a ticker tape you know it just seems like a fun idea. I know it might be bad web design but you know what i just wanted to make something cool and quick but you know how it is. anyway im still trying to figure out what the heck i'm going to put on this website, like right now i just have a crappy c++ music player that doesn't fully work. I hope you like it anyway, i'm going to make it look nicer and work with all types of wav files but for now it only plays some, also the mp3 side of it isn't doing so well, sorry about that. I wish i was better at this, at least im happy with this website so far. I really DON'T LIKE wordpress and squarespace im really kind of antagonistic towards them you know gotta just make the website yourself besides wordpress is so hard to navigate whoever made the menus for wordpress is evil and should consider getting a life, don't you think?

                                I have experience in SQL Server Management Studio writing queries and setting up databases. The final project of my database class involved cleaning and reformatting a very large Excel sheet with data to be placed into a SQL server database. Converting it into a CSV and then creating tables to transfer the data to. We wrote several queries with all types of joins, nested queries and other advanced querying techniques to ensure the correct results were pulled and that the tables were correctly formed.

                                x86 assembly was used in a few of my more advanced classes, I have used it to build a simple bootloader for a custom operating system in class. I have a decent understanding of pushing registers and setting up stack frames and a general knowledge of the instruction set. In my compiler class, I wrote lines of x86 to be generated from a LLVM IR parser. I also have a little experience with 6502 and ARM.

                                <p>&#40;A work in progress&#41;. Utilizes the PortAudio library with ASIO drivers. I wrote the logic for the callback function to feed in wav file data to the output buffer. It makes use of a PortAudio library ring buffer to cache the audio data within a thread function and then sends that to the callback function to be sent to the ASIO output buffer. It makes use of global states to know when to pause/stop/resume/play. The program itself uses WIN32 to run as a window. It's capable of WAV and MP3 playback. It displays the track name and number for now. </p>
